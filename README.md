 AWS ECS Infrastructure Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up an AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) infrastructure using Terraform, deploying a containerized API application, configuring load balancing, testing the API, and integrating logging and monitoring.

Setup

1. AWS Account Setup: If you don't have an AWS account, create one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).
   
2. Configure AWS CLI: Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary credentials. You can follow the AWS documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).

3. Install Terraform: Install Terraform on your local machine. You can find installation instructions [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

4. Create Directory for Terraform Configuration: Create a new directory on your local machine to store Terraform configuration files.

## ECS Cluster Setup

1. Define Terraform Configuration: In your Terraform directory, create a `.tf` file to define the ECS cluster configuration. Use the latest ECS-optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Configure autoscaling for ECS instances.

 Containerized Application

1. Dockerize Application: Dockerize a simple API application (e.g., "Hello World" API).

2. Store Docker Image in ECR: Push the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

 ECS Service Setup

1. Define Terraform Configuration: In your Terraform directory, create a `.tf` file to define the ECS service using the Docker image from ECR.
Load Balancer Setup

1. Create Application Load Balancer (ALB): Use Terraform to create an ALB that distributes traffic to the ECS service.
Testing API

1. Test Deployed API: Use a tool like curl or Postman to test the deployed API through the ALB. Ensure you can receive a response from the API.
 Logging and Monitoring

1. Configure Logging: Configure logging for the ECS service.

2. Integrate CloudWatch: Integrate CloudWatch for monitoring the ECS cluster and service.

 Replicating Infrastructure Setup

To replicate the infrastructure setup:

1. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites, including an AWS account, AWS CLI configured, and Terraform installed.

2. Clone or download the repository containing the Terraform configuration files.

3. Modify any configuration files as needed for your specific setup (e.g., update variable values, adjust resource configurations).

4. Follow the deployment steps outlined above to deploy the infrastructure.

Clean Up

To clean up and destroy the created infrastructure:

1. Run `terraform destroy` to destroy all resources created by Terraform.

2. Confirm the destruction by typing `yes` when prompted.

3. Review the list of resources to be destroyed and ensure it matches your expectations.

4. Once the destruction is complete, verify in the AWS Management Console that all resources have been terminated.
