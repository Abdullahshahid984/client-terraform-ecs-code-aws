AWS ECS Infrastructure Deployment Guide
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up an AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) infrastructure using Terraform, deploying a containerized API application, configuring load balancing, testing the API, and integrating logging and monitoring.

Prerequisites
An AWS account
AWS CLI configured with necessary credentials
Terraform installed on your local machine
Setup
AWS Account Setup: If you don't have an AWS account, create one here.

Configure AWS CLI:
Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary credentials. You can follow the AWS documentation here.
Install Terraform: 
Install Terraform on your local machine. You can find installation instructions here. Create Directory for Terraform Configuration: Create a new directory on your local machine to store Terraform configuration files.
ECS Cluster Setup
Define Terraform Configuration: In your Terraform directory, create a .tf file to define the ECS cluster configuration. Use the latest ECS-optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Configure autoscaling for ECS instances.
Containerized Application
Dockerize Application: Dockerize a simple API application (e.g., "Hello World" API).

Store Docker Image in ECR: Push the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

ECS Service Setup
Define Terraform Configuration: In your Terraform directory, create a .tf file to define the ECS service using the Docker image from ECR.
Load Balancer Setup
Create Application Load Balancer (ALB): Use Terraform to create an ALB that distributes traffic to the ECS service.
Testing API
Test Deployed API: Use a tool like curl or Postman to test the deployed API through the ALB. Ensure you can receive a response from the API.
Logging and Monitoring
Configure Logging: Configure logging for the ECS service.
Integrate CloudWatch:
Integrate CloudWatch for monitoring the ECS cluster and service.
